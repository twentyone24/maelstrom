# mailstrom

This bash script is designed to perform load testing on a specified URL using multiple concurrent threads. It includes features for configuring test parameters, logging detailed results, and sending email notifications based on test outcomes.

## Features

- **Configurable Parameters**: Customize the number of requests, concurrency level, URL to test, retry limits, response time thresholds, and success rate thresholds.
- **Detailed Logging**: Captures detailed information about each request, including HTTP status codes and response times.
- **Email Notifications**: Optionally sends email notifications with a summary of test results.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handles interruptions gracefully, ensuring that results are logged and notifications are sent.

## Prerequisites

- **Curl**: Required for making HTTP requests. Ensure it is installed on your system.
- **Mail**: Required for sending email notifications (if enabled). Install a mail utility like `mailx` or `sendmail`.
- **bc**: Required for floating-point arithmetic in shell scripts. Ensure it is installed.

## Configuration

### Configuration File (`maelstrom.conf`)

The script reads configuration values from `maelstrom.conf`. Here’s an example of how to structure this file:

```bash
# maelstrom.conf
N=1000
THREADS=10
URL=https://api.sampleapis.com/coffee/hot
RETRY_LIMIT=3
THRESHOLD_TIME=2.0
THRESHOLD_SUCCESS=95
EMAIL_ENABLED=false
EMAIL_TO=
```

### Parameters

- **Number of requests (`N`)**: Total number of HTTP requests to be performed.
- **Number of concurrent threads (`THREADS`)**: Number of concurrent threads to be used for the load test.
- **URL to test (`URL`)**: The endpoint URL where the load test will be executed.
- **Retry limit (`RETRY_LIMIT`)**: Number of retry attempts for failed requests.
- **Response time threshold (`THRESHOLD_TIME`)**: Maximum acceptable response time in seconds.
- **Success rate threshold (`THRESHOLD_SUCCESS`)**: Minimum acceptable success rate percentage.
- **Enable email notifications (`EMAIL_ENABLED`)**: Boolean value to enable or disable email notifications.
- **Email address for notifications (`EMAIL_TO`)**: Recipient email address for notifications.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Configuration File**

   Create a `maelstrom.conf` file in the same directory as the script. Set your desired configuration values as described in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

2. **Run the Script**

   Make the script executable and run it:

   ```bash
   chmod +x load_test.sh
   ./load_test.sh
   ```

3. **Monitor the Load Test**

   The script will output progress and results to the terminal. You can monitor real-time updates during the test.

4. **Review Results**

   Upon completion, the script will display results including total requests, successful requests, failed requests, average response time, and success rate.

5. **Email Notifications**

   If email notifications are enabled, the script will send an email with the test results to the specified address.

## Handling Interruptions

The script is designed to handle interruptions gracefully. To stop the test, press `Ctrl+C` or send a termination signal. The script will log the results and send email notifications if configured.
